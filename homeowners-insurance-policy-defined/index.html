            </p><p>I just came back from a flight and had my seat reassigned to accommodate for a family wanting to sit together. What is the rear legroom like on these? Hi, i have some questions regarding seat reservations for this bus (image). But 30 inch legroom is ridiculous even for someone average height and aa and united have seats at 30 inch. I would agree that at least 31 inch legroom is ok for someone. When i sat down, i noticed there was a few extra inches of legroom compared to. Still missing the point, i know all that, i am just asking for a measure, it is not hard to understand. Jal is 9 abreast on 777s (vs 10 for basically all other major carriers) and 8 abreast on the 787 (vs 9).</p>
