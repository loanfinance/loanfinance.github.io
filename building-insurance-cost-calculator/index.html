            </p><p>If the building was built in 2000, this means that the building was finished in 2000. My instinct, with all respect!, would be that it was more than just a difference between american english and british english. I think you would be better off using. The building process seems to be completed. Any building on the other side of the street is across the street from my house, but only one is generally directly opposite. Just across doesn't make as much sense to me. A building might be able to represent something, even an achievement, but it is very clear that this particular sentence only makes sense if the building is itself the achievement. The sentence that i think i might have most.</p>

        <p>Just across doesn&#039;t make as much sense to me. The past participle is &#039;built&#039; used adjectivally, if you like, after the verb (to) &#039;be&#039;, while &#039;build&#039; is the infinitive form. My instinct, with all respect!, would be that it was more than just a difference between american english and british english.</p>
