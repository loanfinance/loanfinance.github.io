His affliction caused him to/made him do bad things. B is used for anno bezos, a dark timeline when amazon runs everything and we are forced to drink a nutrient slurry from rusty pipes as we toil deep in the aws mines, mating. Voluntary redundancy as opposed to compulsory redundancy is something unions fight for. Maybe i am wrong, but i believe okay shouldn’t be used in a formal communication.
