            </p><p>His affliction caused him to/made him do bad things. Sucks may be considered mildly vulgar by some. The transitive to lead means to cause someone (the direct object is a person) to do something and follows the same structure verb+someone+infinitive as many other. B is used for anno bezos, a dark timeline when amazon runs everything and we are forced to drink a nutrient slurry from rusty pipes as we toil deep in the aws mines, mating. I know that it's a comma splice since i've. As the rainforest becomes smaller and smaller in size, wildlife are forced to leave the rainforest, some may carry potential diseases. I don't know why, but sometimes when. Voluntary redundancy as opposed to compulsory redundancy is something unions fight for.</p>
