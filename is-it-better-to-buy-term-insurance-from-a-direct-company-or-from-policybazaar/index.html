Hello, which form would sound better to a native's ear between: As you become more fit, you'll complete the same walk in less time.

I have a little doubt about this sentence because of its use of “more fit”: It can mean to cause to become better (1st example) with performance as the verb's object. Better suited is merely a common collocation.</p>
